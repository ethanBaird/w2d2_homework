A diagram of 3 classes: Train, Passenger, Carriage

The diagram indicates some attributs within the middle box and methods within the bottom box which belong to the class titled in the top box

The lines between the 3 classes indicate how they relate to one another

eg. the Train class has attributes: operator, num_of_passengers etc, and methods: collect_passengers() and add_carriages().

These diagrams can be used to plan your code for writing classes, and once they are written provide a tool to remember how you designed them.
